 Two of 'em. Both had my father in 'em. It's peculiar. I'm older now than he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, the first one I don't remember too well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. But the second one it was like we was both back in the older times and I was a horseback goin' through the mountains of a night. Goin' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin'. Never said nothin'. He just rode on past and he had this blanket wrapped around him and he had his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.
